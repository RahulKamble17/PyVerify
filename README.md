# PyVerify
A prototype/ an idea of a one stop app to verify Python Packages based on different criteria

Its a best practice to minimize & verify an application's dependencies to ensure we build a robust app. So here's a simple prototype that uses OpenAI's GPT 4 API that takes your package name as input and provides info on its popularity/maintenance, compatibility at the click of a button using pre-written Prompts.

Instructions:
1. Replace the Open AI credentials with your own
2. Simply run the python file, give the streamlit command on console
3. The app should open on your web browser
